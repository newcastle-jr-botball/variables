Let's say we want to store how many apples we have. We may need to access this information from many places within our script. If we have a lot of apples, we don't want to have to count them every time we need to know how many we have. This is an example of where a *variable* would come in. \r\n\r\nLet's say we have 148 apples.\r\n\r\nYou can think of a variable as a labeled box. We can take a box and put the number 148 inside of it. Then, on the outside of the box, we can put a label on it. Let's call it \"number_of_apples\". So, every time that we need to know how many apples we have, we just need to access that box and see what the number is inside the box: 148.\r\n\r\nIn code, we do just about the same thing. We \"name\" our variable (number_of_apples), and set a \"value\" to it (148). This is what it looks like:\r\n\r\n    int number_of_apples = 148;\r\n\r\n* The __int__ tells us what type of data we want to store (it's called a data type - we'll learn that in a later lesson) -- for now, when we want to store a whole number, we use \"int\" which is short for integer.\r\n* The next section is the __label__ - what we want to call our variable.\r\n* The next is the __assignment__ which is the equals sign (=) - We are setting the value of number_of_apples \"equal to\" 148.\r\n* The next part is the __value__: 148.\r\n\r\nWe can use our variable by name:\r\n\r\n     printf(\"We have %d apples.\\n\", number_of_apples);\r\n\r\nThis will print \"We have 148 apples.\" to the console. Or in a conditional:\r\n\r\n    if (number_of_apples == 148) {\r\n        // yes, we have 148 apples\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd we can __reassign__ a new value at any time within our code. Let's say we've dropped 10 of our apples. We can then do this:\r\n\r\n    number_of_apples = 138;\r\n    //Or, we can calculate the number directly:\r\n    number_of_apples = number_of_apples - 10; // this will assign the result to number_of_apples\r\n\r\nIn this way, the value of the variable __varies__ - it can change at any time. That is where we get the name.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note:*\r\n\r\nThe code used in these tutorials is intended to run on the KIPR Link controller and written in \r\nthe KISS Platform.
